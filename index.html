  <h1>Cities I Have Lived In:</h1>
  <p>I was born and raised in Lincoln, NE and moved out to Boulder, CO when I was 18 for culinary school. After I graduated from culinary school I went to Aspen, CO for my first job.  Then I relocated to Carbondale, CO for my second job.  There I met my husband and when he got a job in Denver, CO we moved down here.</p>
